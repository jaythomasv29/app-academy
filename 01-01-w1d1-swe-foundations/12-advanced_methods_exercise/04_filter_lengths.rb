# Write a method, filter_lengths(strings, length), that accepts an array of strings
# and a length as args. The method should return an array containing the strings
# that have at least the given length. The length argument should be optional; if no length
# is passed in, then 5 should be used as the length.
def filter_lengths(sent_arr, length = 5) # default arg
  sent_arr.select { |word| word.length >= length } # return a new array that contains words that are at least a given length
